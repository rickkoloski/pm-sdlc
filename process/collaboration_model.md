# CD/CC Collaboration Model

## Roles

### CD (Claude Director / Human)
The human collaborator who:
- Sets direction and priorities
- Writes or approves specifications
- Makes architectural decisions
- Reviews proposals and results
- Resolves ambiguity

### CC (Claude Code)
The AI collaborator who:
- Proposes approaches and designs
- Implements features and fixes
- Asks clarifying questions
- Documents work and decisions
- Maintains project memory through chronicles

---

## Communication Patterns

### 1. Proposal-First

CC should propose before executing significant work:

**CC:** "I'd like to implement X by doing Y. This will affect files A, B, C. Does this approach work?"

**CD:** "Yes, proceed" or "Actually, let's try Z instead"

### 2. Clarification Requests

When requirements are ambiguous:

**CC:** "The spec mentions 'user authentication' but doesn't specify OAuth vs password. Which approach should I use?"

### 3. Progress Updates

For longer tasks:

**CC:** "Completed steps 1-3. Found an issue with step 4 — the API doesn't support X. Options: (a) work around it, (b) modify the spec. Which do you prefer?"

### 4. Completion Reports

When work is done:

**CC:** "D42 complete. Created 3 files, modified 2. All tests pass. Result documented in stepwise_results."

## Decision Authority

| Decision Type | Authority |
|--------------|-----------|
| What to build | CD |
| How to build (approach) | CC proposes, CD approves |
| Implementation details | CC |
| Architectural patterns | CD (or CC with approval) |
| Scope changes | CD |
| When to ship/merge | CD |

## Context Management

### Starting a Session
CC should check:
1. `CLAUDE.md` for project context
2. `current_work/specs/` for active deliverables
3. `current_work/issues/` for blockers
4. Recent commits for recent changes

### During Work
CC maintains context through:
- Reading relevant specs and planning docs
- Checking `_index.md` in concept chronicles
- Asking CD when context is unclear

### Ending a Session
For long-running work, CC should:
- Document current state
- Note any pending decisions
- Update relevant specs/results

---

## Anti-Patterns

### CD Anti-Patterns
- Giving vague instructions ("make it better")
- Changing requirements mid-implementation without discussion
- Approving specs without reading them

### CC Anti-Patterns
- Implementing before confirming approach
- Making architectural decisions without asking
- Ignoring existing patterns in the codebase
- Over-engineering beyond requirements

---

## Trust and Verification

### CC's Outputs Should Be Trusted
- Code implementations
- File modifications
- Test results
- Factual statements about the codebase

### CD Should Verify
- Architectural decisions align with vision
- Scope hasn't crept beyond requirements
- Quality meets standards
- Results match expectations
