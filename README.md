# SDLC Framework

A reusable Software Development Lifecycle framework for AI-assisted development projects using Claude Code (CC).

## Overview

This framework defines:
- **Process:** How work flows from idea → spec → implementation → archive
- **Artifacts:** Standard document types and their purposes
- **Structure:** Directory organization for active work and chronicles
- **Collaboration:** How CD (Claude Director/human) and CC work together

## Quick Start

To apply this framework to an existing project:

1. Open the project in Claude Code
2. Add this directory to your workspace: `~/src/SDLC`
3. Say: **"Let's implement the SDLC process from ~/src/SDLC"**

CC will:
- Analyze your existing documentation
- Propose a categorization and structure
- Create the directory structure in your project
- Copy relevant templates
- Customize for your project

## Core Concepts

### Deliverable IDs
Sequential identifiers (D1, D2, ... Dnn) that track work across the project lifetime.

### Current Work vs Chronicles
- `current_work/` — Active deliverables being worked on
- `chronicle_by_concept/` — Completed work organized by domain
- `chronicle_by_step/` — Completed work organized chronologically

### Artifact Types
| Type | Location | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| Spec | `specs/` | Define what to build |
| Planning | `planning/` | Define how to build it |
| Prompt | `prompts/` | Instructions for CC |
| Result | `stepwise_results/` | Record of completion |
| Issue | `issues/` | Blocked items |
