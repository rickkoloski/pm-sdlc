# D42: Memory Formation Layer — Complete

**Spec:** `d42_memory_formation_layer_spec.md`
**Completed:** 2026-01-25

---

## Summary

Implemented the Memory Formation Layer that automatically creates memories from domain events based on configurable rules. Events now flow through the formation layer which evaluates them against rules and creates memories with full provenance tracking.

---

## Implementation Details

### What Was Built

- FormationRule schema and migrations
- FormationLayer GenServer for event processing
- Rule evaluation engine with pattern matching
- Provenance tracking for formed memories
- Seed data for initial formation rules

### Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `lib/vnext_server/memory/formation_rule.ex` | Rule schema |
| `lib/vnext_server/memory/formation_layer.ex` | Core formation logic |
| `priv/repo/migrations/*_create_memory_formation_rules.exs` | DB migration |
| `test/vnext_server/memory/formation_layer_test.exs` | Unit tests |

### Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `lib/vnext_server/application.ex` | Added FormationLayer to supervision tree |
| `lib/vnext_server/memory.ex` | Added formation-related functions |

---

## Testing

### Tests Run
- [x] Unit tests: 12 passing
- [x] Integration tests: 3 passing
- [x] Manual testing: Verified event → memory flow

### Test Coverage
Formation layer module: 94% coverage

---

## Deviations from Spec

- Added `metadata` field to FormationRule for extensibility (not in original spec)
- Used GenServer instead of simple module for better event handling

---

## Follow-Up Items

- [ ] D45: Add AI-based importance scoring
- [ ] Consider rule priority/ordering for overlapping patterns

---

## Notes

Formation rules are seeded with sensible defaults for party_created, contact_added, and communication events. Rules can be modified via IEx or future admin UI.
